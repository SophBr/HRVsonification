# HRVsonification
Sound examples of Heart Rate Variability Data sonified with SuperCollider

These examples have been created as part of my bachelor's thesis.
Heart rate data of two individuals was collected during asynchronous and synchronous tasks such as exercise or paced breathing.

The Heart Rate Variability data (RR-intervals) was z-transformed for each participant and differences withing the dyad were computed. These RR-differences, as well as the differences in RMSSDs and High Frequency Heart Rate Variability were transformed into frequencies and sonified using SuperCollider. The sounds were recorded using Audacity and uploaded here as examples for the results of the sonification process used during my thesis.

If you have any questions regarding the pre-processing of the data, the sonification with SuperCollider or the design of the experiment, please let me know! I will do my best to upload the code and more details about the thesis as soon as it is done and graded.
